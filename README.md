# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Configure required environment variables
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_TICKETMASTER_API_KEY=your_ticketmaster_api_key
```

**5. Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
# Application available at http://localhost:5173
```

## Production Deployment

**Automated CI/CD Pipeline**
The application uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

```yaml
# Automated workflow includes:
